# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The objectives of this challenge were:

* add a weather description to weather data previously retrieved, 

* create input statements for beta testers to enter their desired temperature ranges, which will be will be used to identify potential vacation destinations and nearby hotels; and 

* from the list of potential vacation destinations, a travel interary will be created for four cities.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

**Weather Database**

Using OpenWeatherMap, a random set of 2,000 latitudes and longitudes were created and nearest cities were retrieved, including the following weather data:

•	Maximum temperature

•	Percent humidity

•	Percent cloudiness

•	Wind speed

•	Current weather description

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map!
